## Far Vision
For health- and care-provider agency managers who need tools to aggregate data for decision making and generating reports for both donors and legal authorities, our services are a reporting tool that helps its users collect, aggregate, and review product-wide data and statistics. Our reporting services provides comprehensive reports that give a detailed overview of the entire system as well as generates specific legal documents required by law and expected by the agency’s donors.


## Near Vision
Emphasize the user-centric nature of the reporting tool. Make it clear that the design and content of reports will be tailored to the specific needs and roles of different entities, ensuring a seamless and user-friendly experience.

Allow users to customize their reports to some extent. For example, agencies may want to choose specific data fields, date ranges, or sorting options to suit their unique requirements.

Ensure that the reporting tool provides real-time or near-real-time data updates. This will enable agencies and patients to make informed decisions based on the most current information available.

Incorporation of interactive elements into the reports, such as charts, graphs, and filters. This allows users to quickly visualize and analyze data to gain deeper insights.

Include options for exporting reports in various formats (PDF, Excel, etc.) and sharing them easily with relevant parties. This promotes collaboration and communication among stakeholders.

 * Patients - are the ones who receives services managed using our reports
 * Donors - require general information about the entire service and its capabilities provided by the Agency Management before making a donation

## Backlog Rationale
The backlog items are prioritized according to the following factors:
1. Whether there are other services that are a part of the core functionality depending on this PBI (e.g., Case Mangers have to access the patient's progress report to develop/review a plan)
2. Whether this PBI is required for the agency to comply with the law (e.g., Federal Reports)
3. Whether this PBI adds features significantly increasing usability of the product (e.g., exporting reports)
4. Whether this PBI is needed for a product improvement (e.g., Agency Manager needs reports/data for better decision making)
5. Other

*The first factor has the highest priority, while the last factor has the lowest priority

## Estimations
**1 Story Point = 4 man-hours**

All current estimations take into account the lack of design details from the teams who own the data. Therefore, such PBIs are planned to take the maximum number of story points (8). The estimations will be updated once more information is available.

Only Development Team members participated in creating the estimates.
